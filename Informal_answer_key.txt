Similarly, algorithms that expect a corpus to follow a set of conventions for a written language are frequently not robust enough to handle a variety of corpora.
It is notoriously difficult to prescribe rules governing the use of a written language; it is even more difficult to get people to “follow the rules.
This is in large part due to the nature of written language, in which the conventions are determined by publishing houses and national academies and are arbitrarily subject to change.
So while punctuation roughly corresponds to the use of suprasegmental features in spoken language, reliance on well-formed sentences delimited by predictable punctuation can be very problematic.
In many corpora, traditional prescriptive rules are commonly ignored.
This fact is particularly important to our discussion of both word and sentence segmentation, which to a large degree depend on the regularity of spacing and punctuation.
Most existing segmentation algorithms for natural languages are both language-specific and corpus-dependent, developed to handle the predictable ambiguities in a well-formed text.
Depending on the origin and purpose of a text, capitalization and punctuation rules may be followed very closely.
